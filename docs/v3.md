v3 Release
==========

Mockery releases version 3 of the project that provides a number of high-profile benefits over v2:

1. Allows generation of [`moq`](template-moq.md)-style templates. The https://github.com/matryer/moq project is being folded into mockery to combine the speed and configuration flexibility of mockery with the simplicity of moq-style mocks.
2. Changes the generation scheme to be entirely driven off of Go templates. This means that the data provided to templates is considered as part of the public API.
3. Mockery now allows users to specify their own templates to make code generation far easier. Mockery handles the problem of parsing source code and enables you to focus on creating [your own interface implementations](templates.md#template-file).
4. Shedding all deprecated variables and simplifying the way in which mocks are configured.
