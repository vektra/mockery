mockery
=======

mockery provides the ability to easily generate mocks for golang interfaces. It removes
the boilerplate coding required to use mocks.

### Installation

`go get github.com/vektra/mockery/.../`, then `$GOPATH/bin/mockery`

### Examples

#### Simplest case

Given this is in `string.go`

```go
package test

type Stringer interface {
	String() string
}
```

Run: `mockery -name=Stringer` and the following will be output to `mocks/Stringer.go`:

```go
package mocks

import "github.com/stretchr/testify/mock"

type Stringer struct {
	mock.Mock
}

func (m *Stringer) String() string {
	ret := m.Called()

	var r0 string
	if rf, ok := ret.Get(0).(func() string); ok {
		r0 = rf()
	} else {
		r0 = ret.Get(0).(string)
	}

	return r0
}
```

#### Next level case

See [github.com/jaytaylor/mockery-example](https://github.com/jaytaylor/mockery-example)
for the fully runnable version of the outline below.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"

	"github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/aws"
	"github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/service/s3"
	"github.com/jaytaylor/mockery-example/mocks"
	"github.com/stretchr/testify/mock"
)

func main() {
	mockS3 := &mocks.S3API{}

	mockResultFn := func(input *s3.ListObjectsInput) *s3.ListObjectsOutput {
		output := &s3.ListObjectsOutput{}
		output.SetCommonPrefixes([]*s3.CommonPrefix{
			&s3.CommonPrefix{
				Prefix: aws.String("2017-01-01"),
			},
		})
		return output
	}

	// NB: .Return(...) must return the same signature as the method being mocked.
	//     In this case it's (*s3.ListObjectsOutput, error).
	mockS3.On("ListObjects", mock.MatchedBy(func(input *s3.ListObjectsInput) bool {
		return input.Delimiter != nil && *input.Delimiter == "/" && input.Prefix == nil
	})).Return(mockResultFn, nil)

	listingInput := &s3.ListObjectsInput{
		Bucket:    aws.String("foo"),
		Delimiter: aws.String("/"),
	}
	listingOutput, err := mockS3.ListObjects(listingInput)
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}

	for _, x := range listingOutput.CommonPrefixes {
		fmt.Printf("common prefix: %+v\n", *x)
	}
}
```

### Imports

mockery pulls in all the same imports used in the file that contains the interface so
that package types will work correctly. It then runs the output through the `imports`
package to remove any unnecessary imports (as they'd result in compile errors).

### Types

mockery should handle all types. If you find it does not, please report the issue.

### Return Value Provider Functions

If your tests need access to the arguments to calculate the return values,
set the return value to a function that takes the method's arguments as its own
arguments and returns the return value. For example, given this interface:

```go
package test

type Proxy interface {
  passthrough(ctx context.Context, s string) string
}
```

The argument can be passed through as the return value:

```go
import . "github.com/stretchr/testify/mock"

Mock.On("passthrough", mock.AnythingOfType("context.Context"), mock.AnythingOfType("string")).Return(func(ctx context.Context, s string) string {
    return s
})
```

#### Requirements

`Return` must be passed the same argument count and types as expected by the interface. If the return argument signature of `passthrough` in the above example was instead `(string, error)` in the interface, `Return` would also need a second argument to define the error value.

If any return argument is missing, `github.com/stretchr/testify/mock.Arguments.Get` will emit a panic.

For example, `panic: assert: arguments: Cannot call Get(0) because there are 0 argument(s). [recovered]` indicates that `Return` was not provided any arguments but (at least one) was expected based on the interface. `Get(1)` would indicate that the `Return` call is missing a second argument, and so on.

#### Notes

This approach should be used judiciously, as return values should generally
not depend on arguments in mocks; however, this approach can be helpful for
situations like passthroughs or other test-only calculations.

### Name

The `-name` option takes either the name or matching regular expression of interface to generate mock(s) for.

### All

It's common for a big package to have a lot of interfaces, so mockery provides `-all`.
This option will tell mockery to scan all files under the directory named by `-dir` ("." by default)
and generates mocks for any interfaces it finds. This option implies `-recursive=true`.

`-all` was designed to be able to be used automatically in the background if required.

### Recursive

Use the `-recursive` option to search subdirectories for the interface(s).
This option is only compatible with `-name`. The `-all` option implies `-recursive=true`.

### Output

mockery always generates files with the package `mocks` to keep things clean and simple.
You can control which mocks directory is used by using `-output`, which defaults to `./mocks`.

### In Package (-inpkg) and KeepTree (-keeptree)

For some complex repositories, there could be multiple interfaces with the same name but in different packages. In that case, `-inpkg` allows generate the mocked interfaces directly in the package that it mocks.

In the case you don't want to generate the mocks into the package but want to keep a similar structure, use the option `-keeptree`.

## Casing

mockery generates files using the casing of the original interface name.  This
can be modified by specifying `-case=underscore` to format the generated file
name using underscore casing.

### Debug

Use `mockery -print` to have the resulting code printed out instead of written to disk.

### Mocking interfaces in `main`

When your interfaces are in the main package you should supply the `-inpkg` flag.
This will generate mocks in the same package as the target code avoiding import issues.
