Description: # mike
        **mike** is a Python utility that makes it easy to deploy multiple versions of
        your [MkDocs](http://www.mkdocs.org)-powered docs to a Git branch, suitable for
        hosting on Github via `gh-pages`. To see an example of this in action, take a
        look at the documentation for [bfg9000][bfg9000].
        
        ## Why Use mike?
        
        mike is built around the idea that once you've generated your docs for a
        particular version, you should never need to touch that version again. This
        means you never have to worry about breaking changes in MkDocs, since your old
        docs (built with an old version of MkDocs) are already generated and sitting in
        your `gh-pages` branch.
        
        While mike is flexible, it's optimized around putting your docs in a
        `<major>.<minor>` directory, with optional aliases (e.g. `latest` or `dev`) to
        particularly notable versions. This makes it easy to make permalinks to whatever
        version of the documentation you want to direct people to.
        
        ## How It Works
        
        mike works by creating a new Git commit on your `gh-pages` branch every time you
        deploy a new version of your docs using `mike deploy` (or other mike subcommands
        that change your `gh-pages` branch). When deploying a particular version,
        previously-deployed docs for that version are erased and overwritten, but docs
        for other versions remain untouched.
        
        ## Installation
        
        Like most Python projects, mike uses [setuptools][setuptools], so installation
        is what you might expect:
        
        ```sh
        pip install mike
        ```
        
        Once you've installed mike, you might also want to set up shell-completion for
        it. If you have [shtab][shtab] installed, you can do this with
        `mike generate-completion`, which will print the shell-completion code for your
        shell. For more details on how to set this up, consult shtab's
        [documentation][shtab-setup].
        
        ## Usage
        
        ### Before Using Mike
        
        Before using mike for the first time, you may want to use [`mike delete
        --all`](#deleting-docs) to delete any old documentation on your `gh-pages`
        branch before building your new versioned docs. (If you prefer, you can also
        manually move your old documentation to a subdirectory of your `gh-pages` branch
        so that it's still accessible.)
        
        ### Configuration
        
        To help integrate into the MkDocs build process, mike uses an MkDocs plugin.
        This plugin is added by default when building your documentation with mike, but
        by adding it explicitly to your `mkdocs.yml` file, you can configure how the
        plugin works. The plugin adds a version selector to supported themes as well as
        updating the `site_url` (if you set it) to point to the version of the docs that
        are being built:
        
        ```yaml
        plugins:
          - mike:
              # These fields are all optional; the defaults are as below...
              alias_type: symlink
              redirect_template: null
              deploy_prefix: ''
              canonical_version: null
              version_selector: true
              css_dir: css
              javascript_dir: js
        ```
        
        * `alias_type`: The method to create aliases; one of:
          * `symlink`: Create a symbolic link from the alias to the base directory of
            the documentation
          * `redirect`: Create an HTML redirect for each page of the documentation
          * `copy`: Copy all the files of the documentation to the alias's path
        * `redirect_template`: The template file to use when creating HTML redirects; if
          `null`, use the default template
        * `deploy_prefix`: The root directory to put the generated docs in; this can be
          useful if you'd like to have other pages at the root of your site, or to host
          multiple, independently-versioned sets of docs side by side
        * `canonical_version`: The "canonical" version to use for the documentation,
          useful for telling search engines what pages to prefer (e.g. `latest` if
          you've defined that as an alias that always points to the latest release); if
          `null`, mike will use the version specified via `mike deploy`
        * `version_selector`: True if the version selector should be shown on pages;
          false otherwise
        * `css_dir`: The directory to place the version selector's CSS
        * `javascript_dir`: The directory to place the version selector's Javascript
        
        ### Building Your Docs
        
        mike is designed to produce one version of your docs at a time. That way, you
        can easily deploy a new version without touching any older versions of your
        docs; this can be especially important if your old docs are no longer buildable
        with the newest version of MkDocs (or if they weren't built with MkDocs at
        all!). To deploy the current version of your docs, simply run:
        
        ```sh
        mike deploy [version]
        ```
        
        Where `[version]` is the current version of your project, represented however
        you like (I recommend using `[major].[minor]` and excluding the patch
        number). You can also pass aliases to the `deploy` command to host a
        particularly-relevant version of your docs somewhere special (e.g. `latest`):
        
        ```sh
        mike deploy [version] [alias]...
        ```
        
        If `[version]` already exists, this command will *also* update all of the
        pre-existing aliases for it. Normally, if an alias specified on the command line
        is already associated with another version, this will return an error. If you
        *do* want to move an alias from another version to this version (e.g. when
        releasing a new version and updating the `latest` alias to point to this new
        version), you can pass `-u`/`--update-aliases` to allow this.
        
        By default, each alias creates a symbolic link to the base directory of the real
        version of the docs; to create a copy of the docs for each alias, you can pass
        `--alias-type=copy`, or to use a simple HTML redirect for each page, you can
        pass `--alias-type=redirect`. If you're using redirects, you can customize the
        redirect template with `-T`/`--template`; this takes a path to a [Jinja][jinja]
        template that accepts an `{{href}}` variable.
        
        If you'd like to specify a title for this version that doesn't match the version
        string, you can pass `-t TITLE`/`--title=TITLE` as well.
        
        In addition, you can specify where to deploy your docs via `-b`/`--branch`,
        `-r`/`--remote`, and `--deploy-prefix`, specifying the branch, remote, and
        directory prefix within the branch, respectively. Finally, to push your docs to
        a remote branch, simply add `-p`/`--push` to your command.
        
        You can also specify many of these options via your `mkdocs.yml` configuration
        as shown above. For example, `--alias-type` can also be specified via
        `plugins.mike.alias_type`. (For `--branch` and `--remote`, you can use the
        built-in MkDocs fields `remote_branch` and `remote_name`.)
        
        ### Viewing Your Docs
        
        To test that your docs have been built as expected, you can serve them locally
        from a dev server:
        
        ```sh
        mike serve
        ```
        
        By default, this serves the docs on `http://localhost:8000`, but you can
        change this with `-a`/`--dev-addr`. Remember though, *this is for testing only*.
        To host your docs for real, you should use a real web server.
        
        ### Deleting Docs
        
        Sometimes you need to delete an old version of your docs, either because you
        made a mistake or you're pruning unsupported versions. You can do this via the
        `delete` subcommand:
        
        ```sh
        mike delete [identifier]...
        ```
        
        If `identifier` is a version, this will delete the version and all its aliases
        from the branch; if it's an alias, it will only delete that alias.
        
        If you'd like to *completely* wipe the contents of your docs branch, just run
        `mike delete --all`. Like `deploy` above, you can specify `--branch`, `--push`,
        etc to control how the commit is handled.
        
        ### Listing Docs
        
        If you ever need to see the list of all currently-deployed doc versions, you can
        run:
        
        ```sh
        mike list
        ```
        
        To list the info for a particular version, you can just pass the version name or
        an alias to that version:
        
        ```sh
        mike list [identifier]
        ```
        
        Sometimes, you need this information to be consumed by another tool. In that
        case, pass `-j`/`--json` to return the list of doc versions as JSON.
        
        ### Setting the Default Version
        
        With all the versions of docs you have, you may want to set a *default* version
        so that people going to the root of your site are redirected to the latest
        version of the docs:
        
        ```sh
        mike set-default [identifier]
        ```
        
        If you want to use a different template from the default, you can pass
        `-T`/`--template`; this takes a path to a [Jinja][jinja] template that accepts
        an `{{href}}` variable.
        
        Like `deploy` and `delete` above, you can specify `--branch`, `--push`,
        etc to control how the commit is handled.
        
        ### Changing a Version's Title
        
        As you update your docs, you may want to change the title of a particular
        version. For example, your `1.0` docs might have the title `1.0.0`, and when you
        release a new patch, you want to update the title to `1.0.1`. You can do this
        with the `retitle` command:
        
        ```sh
        mike retitle [identifier] [title]
        ```
        
        As with other commands that change your docs, you can specify `--branch`,
        `--push`, etc to control how the commit is handled.
        
        ### Adding a New Version Alias
        
        Sometimes, you might need to add a new alias for a version without rebuilding
        your documentation. You can use the `alias` command for this:
        
        ```sh
        mike alias [identifier] [alias]...
        ```
        
        As with `deploy`, you can pass `-u`/`--update-aliases` to change where an
        existing alias points to.
        
        Once again, you can specify `--branch`, `--push`, etc to control how the commit
        is handled.
        
        ### More Details
        
        For more details on the available options, consult the `--help` command for
        mike.
        
        ## Version Ordering
        
        There are lots of versioning schemes out there, but mike tries its best to order
        your versions in a reasonable manner. Version identifiers that "look like"
        versions (e.g. `1.2.3`, `1.0b1`, `v1.0`) are treated as ordinary versions,
        whereas other identifiers, like `devel`, are treated as development versions,
        and placed *above* ordinary versions.
        
        The above scheme should get things right most of the time, but you can always
        post-process your `versions.json` file to manipulate the ordering to suit your
        needs.
        
        ## Staying in Sync
        
        mike will do its best to stay in-sync with your remote repository and will
        automatically update your local branch to match the remote's if possible (note
        that mike *won't* automatically `git fetch` anything). If your local branch has
        diverged from your remote, mike will leave it as-is and ask you what to do. To
        ignore the remote's state, just pass `--ignore`; to update to the remote's
        state, pass `--rebase`.
        
        ## `CNAME` (and Other Special Files)
        
        Some special files that you'd like to deploy along with your documentation (such
        as `CNAME`) aren't related to a particular version of the docs, and instead need
        to go in the root directory of your site. There's no special handling for this
        in mike, but since your built docs live on a Git branch, it's still easy to
        manage: check out your `gh-pages` branch (or wherever your built docs
        live), and commit the necessary files to the root directory.
        
        ## Deploying via CI
        
        Since mike just generates commits to an ordinary Git branch, it should work
        smoothly with your favorite CI system. However, you should keep in mind that
        some CI systems make shallow clones of your repository, meaning that the CI job
        won't have a local instance of your documentation branch to commit to. This will
        naturally cause issues when trying to push the commit. This is easy to resolve
        though; just manually fetch your `gh-pages` branch (or whichever you deploy to)
        before running mike:
        
        ```sh
        git fetch origin gh-pages --depth=1
        ```
        
        You may also need to [configure a Git user][gh-action-commit] so that mike can
        make commits:
        
        ```sh
        git config user.name ci-bot
        git config user.email ci-bot@example.com
        ```
        
        Alternately, you can set the environment variables `GIT_COMMITTER_NAME` and
        `GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL` (as well as `GIT_COMMITTER_DATE` if you like):
        
        ```sh
        GIT_COMMITTER_NAME=ci-bot GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL=ci-bot@example.com \
        mike deploy 1.0
        ```
        
        ## For Theme Authors
        
        If you'd like to provide support for mike in your theme, you just need to
        fetch `versions.json` and build a version selector. `versions.json` looks like
        this:
        
        ```js
        [
          {"version": "1.0", "title": "1.0.1", "aliases": ["latest"]},
          {"version": "0.9", "title": "0.9", "aliases": []}
        ]
        ```
        
        If you're creating a third-party extension to an existing theme, you add a
        setuptools entry point for `mike.themes` pointing to a Python submodule that
        contains `css/` and `js/` subdirectories containing the extra code to be
        installed into the user's documentation. This will then automatically be
        included via the `mike` plugin in the user's `mkdocs.yml` file.
        
        To see some examples of how to work with this, check the
        [`mike/themes/mkdocs`](mike/themes/mkdocs) directory.
